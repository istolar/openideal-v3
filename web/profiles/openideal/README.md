# Quick start

## The steps to Drupal install via UI
1. `git clone -b develop git@github.com:zohar/openideal-v3.git project_name`
2. `cd project_name && composer install`
3. Copy `web/sites/example.settings.local.php` to `web/sites/default/settings.local.php`
4. At the end of the file paste following code (change default values with your database configuration values or leave
if you're using default docker4drupal configuration):
```php
$databases['default']['default'] = [
  'database' => 'drupal',
  'username' => 'drupal',
  'password' => 'drupal',
  'prefix' => '',
  'host' => 'mariadb',
  'port' => '3306',
  'namespace' => 'Drupal\\Core\\Database\\Driver\\mysql',
  'driver' => 'mysql',
];
```
5. Configure your local environment (we recommend using [docker4drupal](https://github.com/wodby/docker4drupal))
6. Open the site URL in your browser and run the install process as usual (or see the next section of this documentation
to up and running the project with one line command)
7. On the installation profile step select 'OpenideaL' installation profile

## The steps to Drupal install via command line (assuming you're using docker4drupal)
1. `git clone -b develop git@github.com:zohar/openideal-v3.git project_name`
2. `cd project_name`
3. Open `.env` file and add initial variables for Drupal installation
4. Run `make`

## Troubleshooting
1. Make sure the composer has been installed on your local machine, otherwise you need to install
the [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) before site installation
2. In this instruction, we're assuming you're using [docker4drupal](https://github.com/wodby/docker4drupal) and your
code files were mounted like this:
```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./code:/var/www/html
```
Otherwise, you need to update Makefile in the project root directory:
```bash
# from:
docker-compose exec php ../vendor/bin/drush
# to:
docker-compose exec php ./vendor/bin/drush
```
3. After installation, you may have different UUID values in the site configuration and in your database.
It may trigger an error during importing/exporting site configuration. It is quite easy to fix with the following
command (run this command from the project root directory):
```bash
drush -y cset system.site uuid $(cat config/sync/system.site.yml | awk '/uuid/ { print $2 }')
```
